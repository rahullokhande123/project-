                Ratan Naval Tata (born 28 December 1937) is an Indian industrialist, philanthropist and former chairman
                of Tata Sons.[2] He was a chairman of the Tata Group from 1990 to 2012,[2] and interim chairman from
                October 2016 through February 2017.[2] He continues to head its charitable trusts.[3][4] In 2008, he
                received the Padma Vibhushan, the second highest civilian honour in India, after receiving the Padma
                Bhushan, the third highest civilian honour in 2000.[5]<br>
                He is the son of Naval Tata, who was adopted by Ratanji Tata, son of Jamsetji Tata, the founder of the
                Tata Group. He graduated from the Cornell University College of Architecture with a bachelor's degree in
                architecture.[6] He joined Tata in 1961, where he worked on the shop floor of Tata Steel. He later
                succeeded J. R. D. Tata as chairman of Tata Sons upon the latter's retirement in 1991. Under his tenure
                the Tata Group acquired Tetley, Jaguar Land Rover, and Corus, in an attempt to turn Tata from a largely
                India-centric group into a global business. Tata is also one of the largest philanthropists in the
                world, having donated around 60–65% of his income to charity.<br>
                Ratan Tata is also a prolific investor and has made numerous investments in several startups. Tata has
                invested in over 30 start-ups till date, most from his personal capacity and some via his investment
                company.[7][8]<br>
                <h3><u>Early life</u></h3>
                <i>Main article:</i>
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tata_family">Tata Family</a>
                Ratan Tata was born in Bombay, now Mumbai, during the British Raj, into a Parsi Zoroastrian family, on
                28 December 1937.[9] He is the son of Naval Tata, who was born in Surat and later adopted into the Tata
                family, and Sooni Tata, the niece of Tata group founder Jamsetji Tata. Tata's biological grandfather,
                Hormusji Tata, was a member of the Tata family by blood. In 1948, when Tata was 10, his parents
                separated, and he was subsequently raised and adopted by Navajbai Tata, his grandmother and widow of
                Ratanji Tata.[10] He has a younger brother Jimmy Tata[11] and a half-brother, Noel Tata, from Naval
                Tata's second marriage with Simone Tata, with whom he was raised.[12]

                He studied at the Campion School, Mumbai till the 8th class. After which, he studied at the Cathedral
                and John Connon School in Mumbai, the Bishop Cotton School in Shimla, and the Riverdale Country School
                in New York City, which he graduated from in 1955.[13][14][15] After graduating from high school, Tata
                enrolled in Cornell University, from which he graduated with a bachelor's degree in architecture in
                1959. In 2008, Tata gifted Cornell $50 Million, becoming the largest international donor in the
                university's history.[16]<br>

                In the 1970s, Tata was given a managerial position in the Tata group. He achieved initial success by
                turning the subsidiary National Radio and Electronics (NELCO) around, only to see it collapse during an
                economic slowdown.[17][18] In 1991, J. R. D. Tata stepped down as chairman of Tata Sons, naming him his
                successor. Initially, Tata faced stiff resistance from the heads of various subsidiaries, who had a
                large amount of operational freedom under the senior Tata's tenure. In response, Tata implemented a
                number of policies designed to consolidate power, including the implementation of a retirement age,
                having subsidiaries report directly to the group office, and requiring subsidiaries to contribute their
                profit to building the Tata group brand. Tata prioritised innovation and delegated many responsibilities
                to younger talent.[19] Under his leadership, overlapping operations between subsidiaries were
                streamlined into company-wide operations, with the group exiting unrelated businesses to take on
                globalisation.[20]

                During the 21 years Tata led the Tata Group, revenues grew over 40 times, and profit over 50 times.[17]
                When he took over the company, sales overwhelmingly comprised commodity sales, but at the end of his
                tenure, the majority of sales came from brands.[21][22] He had Tata Tea acquire Tetley, Tata Motors
                acquire Jaguar Land Rover, and Tata Steel acquire Corus. These acquisitions repositioned Tata from a
                largely India-centric group into a global business, with over 65% of revenues coming from operations and
                sales internationally.[17]<br>

                He also conceptualized and spearheaded the development of the Tata Nano car, which helped put cars at a
                price-point within reach of the average Indian consumer.[23][19] Tata Motors has since rolled out the
                first batch of Tigor Electric Vehicles from its Sanand Plant in Gujarat, which Tata has described as
                "fast-forward[ing] India's electric<br>
                Upon turning 75, Ratan Tata resigned his executive powers in the Tata group on 28 December 2012. An
                ensuing leadership crisis over his succession drew intense media scrutiny.[25] The board of directors
                and legal division of the company refused to appoint his successor, Cyrus Mistry, a relative of Tata and
                the son of Pallonji Mistry of the Shapoorji Pallonji Group, which was the largest individual shareholder
                of the Tata group.[26][27] On 24 October 2016, Cyrus Mistry was removed as chairman of Tata Sons, and
                Ratan Tata was made interim chairman. A selection committee, which included Tata as a member, was formed
                to find a successor.[28] On 12 January 2017, Natarajan Chandrasekaran was named as the chairman of Tata
                Sons, a role he assumed in February 2017. In February 2017, Mistry was removed as a director for Tata
                Sons.[29] The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal later found in December 2019 that the removal of
                Cyrus Mistry as the chairman of Tata Sons was illegal, and ordered that he be reinstated.[29] On appeal,
                India's Supreme Court upheld the dismissal of Cyrus Mistry.[30]
                Tata has also invested in multiple companies with his own wealth. He has invested in Snapdeal – one of
                India's leading e-commerce websites. In January 2016, he invested in Teabox, an online premium Indian
                Tea seller,[31] and CashKaro.com, a discount coupons and cash-back website.[32] He has made small
                investments in both early and late stage companies in India, such as INR 0.95 Cr in Ola Cabs.[33] In
                April 2015, it was reported that Tata had acquired a stake in Chinese smartphone startup Xiaomi.[34] In
                2016, he invested in Nestaway an online real-estate portal that later acquired Zenify to start the
                online real-estate and pet-care portal, Dogspot.[35][36][37][38] Tata also launched India's
                companionship startup for senior citizens, Goodfellows, in a bid to encourage intergenerational
                friendships."[39]
